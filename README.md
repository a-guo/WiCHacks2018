# WiCHacks2018

## Inspiration
Walking around at night is intimidating and a lot of girls feel insecure walking at night in paths they don't know.

## What it does
The goal of WalkDontRun is to come up with the safest and shortest path from a place to another to mainly help girls and women feel safe at night. It also produces a heat map of a the current region's crime rates to best visualize the surrounding paths' danger/red zones and green/safe zones.

## How we built it
The project consisted of two main parts: the front end which is the mobile website and the back end which is the server. The mobile website was built using HTML/CSS/Jquery. We have also used some bootswatch templates to ensure that the website is mobile. The second part of the project, the server, was built using JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us in the team had any experience with using JavaScript in which we planned to build the server with it. While it was very challenging to learn a whole new language in less than 24 hours, we were able to get the sever working with the help of our mentors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having something functional in 24 hours and learning a lot of new things in a short amount of time.

## What we learned
JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and using Google API

## What's next for Walk Don't Run
Improving the back-end algorithm
